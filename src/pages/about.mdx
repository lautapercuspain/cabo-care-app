<h1>Cabo Care Mission</h1>


When I first came to Los Cabos, I was asking myself the following: what happens if I got an eventual emergency, what happens if I need a doctor, or what if I need assistance from an ambulance really quick for saving my life or the life of my loved ones. Well, I thought why not create an app that lets you locate the nearest hospital in case of an emergency?
And after that, we started to build Cabo Care, the first medical and health app from Cabo, and for Cabo. Our mission is not only to save lives but also for improving the quality of life of any person.
This is the beginning of a change in terms of health care. We are proud to say, that we are Cabo Care.
